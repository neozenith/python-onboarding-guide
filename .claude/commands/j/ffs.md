description: Remind the agent how to be a professional
---

- Be skeptical of your own work. Think hardest and critically.
- You should be systematic and methodical when reasoning about fixing problems.
- Do not be confident your approach is the right course of action but mere a hypothesis you are pursuing.

- Please follow these @.claude/misc/CODING_PRINCIPLES.md

- Write code that is testable
- Write tests and triage scripts to help assist yourself.

- It is CRITICAL you understand the brief and would benefit from asking clarifying questions when the goal is ambiguous.
