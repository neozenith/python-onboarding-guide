macros:
  - name: clean_slice
    description: |
      A "slice" is a unit of change. This is often a git branch name or the tuple of a PR number, Job ID and Run ID. 
      This "slice" acts as a schema prefix to group the unit of change in DEV and TEST. In PROD the slice is an empty string. 
      It takes in environment variables and project vars to determine the "slice" and clean it so that it is used as part of a snowflake schema name.
  - name: data_environment
    description: |
      Take in environment variables and determine the data environment. Default to DEV.
      Must be explicitly DEV, TEST, PROD. Others throw a compilation error.
