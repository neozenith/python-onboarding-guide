[https://astral.sh/](https://astral.sh/) are the makers of:

- [`ruff`](https://astral.sh/ruff)
    - drop in replacements for a bunch of Python linting and formatting tools but rewritten in Rust.
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
    - drop in replacement for `pip` and `piptools`

This section needs to get fleshed out better.
